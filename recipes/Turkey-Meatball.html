    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul><li>    cooking spray </li>
    <li> Turkey Meatballs:</li>    
    <li> 1 pound 93% lean ground turkey</li>
    <li> 1 cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
    <li> 1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    <li>Stew:</li>
    <li> ¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
<li>stalks celery, chopped
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups cubed peeled potatoes
1 cup peeled, chopped carrots
1 cup frozen peas
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (Optional) </li></ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat a wire rack with nonstick cooking spray, set on prepared baking sheet, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch balls and place on the baking rack.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, peas, basil, and red pepper flakes; stir until well combined. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and carrots are cooked and the broth has somewhat reduced, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in meatballs and simmer until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper</li>
    </ol>
